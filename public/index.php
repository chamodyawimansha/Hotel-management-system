   <p id="homeP">The vibrant hotel extends its sunny atmosphere into each one of our rooms, even if you choose to close your blinds to get away from the sunshine for a while. It’s not merely about letting the light in – it’s about keeping the warmth of our hotel intact no matter where you are. And nowhere is this more evident than with our many room options that make us one of the top-rated hotels in Negombo, Sri Lanka.Four great ways to recline and relax, offering great views no matter where you are – what more could you want from a beach resort? Sink back into our plush beds, take a relaxing bath and experience the other side of paradise.</p>
